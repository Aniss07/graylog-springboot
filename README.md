Example of using GrayLog with Spring Boot

## Infrastructure
GrayLog uses MongoDB and ElasticSearch behind the scenes. To make this example as simple as possible I've configured the SpringBoot application to fire up embedded versions of both of these. Obviously you shouldn't use this code in a Production environment.
